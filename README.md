# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Tectonic Plates

### Step 1 includes:
  1. The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group.
  2. The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object.
  3. The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer.
  4. The geoJSON() layer adds color and width to the tectonic plate lines.
  5. The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map.
  6. The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page loads.

### Step 2 includes:
  1. The major earthquake data is added as a third layer group.
  2. The major earthquake data is added to the overlay object.
  3. Sets the color and diameter of each earthquake.
  4. The geoJSON() layer creates a circle for each major earthquake.
  5. A popup for each circle is added to the layer to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
  6. The major earthquake layer group variable is added to the map.

### Step 2 includes:
  1. Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.
  2. Added one using Dark and Outdoors themes
